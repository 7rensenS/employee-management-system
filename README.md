A great README.md file is crucial for any project, especially for a job screening where clarity and professionalism are key. It acts as your project's resume, explaining what it is, how to run it, and what it does.

Here's an enhanced README.md content for your Employee Management System, incorporating best practices and ensuring all your task requirements are addressed clearly.

Employee Management System API
Welcome to the Employee Management System (EMS) API! This Spring Boot application provides a comprehensive RESTful platform for managing employees and departments, designed to meet the requirements of your technical assessment.

The goal was to build a robust, scalable, and maintainable API service with proper error handling, validation, and adherence to modern Spring Boot development practices.

🚀 Features
This API covers all specified functionalities, including:

Employee Management:
Create Employee: Add new employees with detailed information (name, date of birth, salary, department, address, role/title, joining date, yearly bonus percentage, and reporting manager).
Update Employee: Modify an existing employee's details.
Move Employee Department: Reassign an employee to a different department.
Fetch All Employees: Retrieve a paginated list of all employees.
Fetch Employee by ID: Get detailed information for a specific employee.
List Employee Names & IDs: Special endpoint to list only names and IDs (/api/employees?lookup=true).
Department Management:
Add Department: Create new departments with a name, creation date, and an optional department head.
Update Department: Modify existing department details.
Delete Department: Remove a department (fails if employees are still assigned).
Fetch All Departments: Retrieve a paginated list of all departments.
Fetch Department by ID: Get details for a specific department.
Expand Employees under Departments: Retrieve a department's details along with its list of assigned employees (/api/departments/{id}?expand=employee or /api/departments?expand=employee).
Data Integrity & Robustness:
Input Validation: Robust validation of all incoming API request payloads using Jakarta Bean Validation (@Valid annotations and constraints like @NotBlank, @NotNull, @DecimalMin, @PastOrPresent).
Global Exception Handling: Centralized, consistent error responses for ResourceNotFoundException, ValidationException, and other unhandled exceptions using @ControllerAdvice.
Complex Logic Handling: Implemented checks for department deletion (preventing deletion if employees are assigned) and handling self-referencing reportingManager relationships.
Performance & Scalability:
Pagination: All GET endpoints automatically paginate responses, providing page number, size, total elements, and total pages for efficient data retrieval. (Default: 20 items per page).
Clear Architecture: Adherence to a standard Spring Boot layered architecture (Controller -> Service -> Repository).
JPA Implementation: Utilizes Spring Data JPA for seamless database interaction with defined entities and repositories.
Bidirectional Relationship Management: Careful handling of @OneToMany and @ManyToOne relationships to ensure data consistency and prevent infinite recursion during JSON serialization.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Java 17+: The core programming language.
Spring Boot 3.2.x: The framework for building robust, stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications.
Spring Data JPA: For simplified data access and persistence with Hibernate as the JPA provider.
H2 Database: An in-memory database used for development and testing, easily swappable with external databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
Maven: Dependency management and build automation tool.
Lombok: Reduces boilerplate code (getters, setters, constructors).
Jakarta Validation (Bean Validation): For declarative validation of input data.
SpringDoc OpenAPI (Swagger UI): For automatic generation of interactive API documentation.
📁 Project Structure

⚙️ Setup and Run
Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine:

Prerequisites:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher installed.
Maven installed (usually comes with modern IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA).
A good Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA (recommended), VS Code, or Eclipse.
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/employee-management-system.git
cd employee-management-system
(Replace <your-username> with your actual GitHub username)

Build the Project:
Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run the Maven build command:

Bash

mvn clean install
This command compiles the code, runs tests, and packages the application.

Run the Application:
You can run the Spring Boot application using Maven:

Bash

mvn spring-boot:run
Alternatively, you can run the EmployeeManagementSystemApplication.java file directly from your IDE.

The application will start on http://localhost:8080.

📖 API Documentation (Swagger UI)
Once the application is running, you can access the interactive API documentation provided by SpringDoc OpenAPI (Swagger UI) at:

➡️ http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

This interface allows you to:

Explore all available API endpoints.
Understand the request and response JSON schemas.
Test API calls directly from your browser.
💾 Database Details
This project uses an H2 in-memory database for simplicity and ease of setup during development and assessment. The database schema is automatically created on startup by Spring Data JPA based on the defined entities (ddl-auto=update).

Database Structure
The core entities are Department and Employee, mapped to departments and employees tables respectively.

departments Table:

Column Name	Data Type	Constraints	Description
id	BIGINT	PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT	Unique identifier for the department
name	VARCHAR(255)	NOT NULL, UNIQUE	Name of the department
creation_date	DATE	NOT NULL	Date the department was established
head_employee_id	BIGINT	FOREIGN KEY (employees.id)	ID of the employee designated as department head (nullable)

Export to Sheets
employees Table:

Column Name	Data Type	Constraints	Description
id	BIGINT	PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT	Unique identifier for the employee
name	VARCHAR(255)	NOT NULL	Full name of the employee
date_of_birth	DATE	NOT NULL	Employee's date of birth
salary	DECIMAL(19,2)	NOT NULL	Employee's yearly salary
department_id	BIGINT	FOREIGN KEY (departments.id)	ID of the department the employee belongs to (nullable)
address	VARCHAR(255)		Employee's residential address
role	VARCHAR(255)	NOT NULL	Employee's job role or title
joining_date	DATE	NOT NULL	Date the employee joined the company
yearly_bonus_percentage	DOUBLE	NOT NULL	Percentage of yearly bonus (e.g., 5.0 for 5%)
reporting_manager_id	BIGINT	FOREIGN KEY (employees.id)	ID of the employee's reporting manager (self-referencing, nullable)

Export to Sheets
H2 Console
You can access the H2 database console to inspect the data directly:

➡️ http://localhost:8080/h2-console

Use the following credentials to connect:

JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:employeedb
User Name: sa
Password: password
Initial Data
Upon application startup, the DataLoader class populates the H2 database with essential sample data, including:

At least 3 departments.
At least 25 employees, demonstrating various relationships (department assignments, reporting managers). This allows for immediate testing of all API endpoints without manual data creation.
⚠️ Error Handling
The API provides clear and consistent error responses using a global exception handler (GlobalExceptionHandler). Common error scenarios include:

404 Not Found: When a requested resource (employee or department) does not exist.
400 Bad Request: For invalid input (e.g., missing required fields, invalid formats due to @Valid annotations) or business rule violations (e.g., attempting to delete a department with active employees).
500 Internal Server Error: For unexpected server-side issues.
Example Error Response Body:

JSON

{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-08T22:30:00.000000",
  "status": 404,
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "Employee not found with ID: 100",
  "path": "/api/employees/100"
}
